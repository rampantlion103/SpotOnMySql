hereâ€™s a high level summary:

Business Requirement: ability to process two files, one from ABS-CBN and another from Kantar to identify which of the spots differ from both files

Output: there are 2 outputs. 1 file will be the spots without any discrepancy and another with the discrepancies in CSV format

Target Go Live Date: Jan 15, 2016

This should be a Web base application.  We can talk further.

Hi Ram,

As discussed we need a program that will match the 2 attached files (one from ABS and the other our own run of the Kantar data.

Output should be:

1.       for matched items:

a.       excel file that can be used to make a realignment plan

b.      excel or other file that will eventually e used to populate BCC

2.       for unmatched items

a.       excel file that can be used to inform ABS that the data has to be revised

As initially mentioned, it would be great if we can have the program by mid January.

Thanks!
Rosebelle

Hi Rosebelle,

Attached, for your reference, are samples of the daily actualized report sent by ABS-CBN as well as our own Kantar run where the reports are being checked against.

For your reference.

Thanks,
